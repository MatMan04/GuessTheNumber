## 📜 How It Works

1. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 20.
2. You are prompted to guess the number.
3. The program tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. The game continues until you guess the correct number.
5. Once you guess correctly, the program displays the number of attempts it took.
